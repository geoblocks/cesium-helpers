# FirstPerson camera mode for CesiumJS

## Demo

[Demo](https://geoblocks.github.io/cesium-helpers/cesium-first-person-mode.html)

## Installation

```bash
npm i --save @geoblocks/cesium-first-person-mode
```

### Usage

```js
import {Viewer} from '@cesium/engine';
import FirstPersonCameraMode from '@geoblocks/cesium-first-person-mode';

const viewer = new Viewer(...);
const mode = new FirstPersonCameraMode(viewer);

// ...
mode.active = true;
```

### Controls

| Action | Mouse | Gamepad (standard mapping) |
|---|---|---|
| Look | move | right stick |
| Zoom in, held | right button, held | L2 / LT, held |
| Field of view | wheel | - |

Holding the zoom narrows the field of view to `mode.zoomFov` (default 20 degrees), never wider than the
view, and slows the look down by as much, as GTA 5's aim; `mode.zoom` goes from 0 to 1 as it zooms in. `mode.lookRate` is the
turn rate of the look at full deflection, in radians per second (default 120 degrees).
The mode starts with a click or a key press, as the Pointer Lock API requires.

The stick and the zoom are the default bindings, `LOOK_BINDINGS`, read with
[cesium-input](../cesium-input). The mode reads its intent from `mode.input` on each tick,
`{look: {x, y}, zoom}`, `look` the turn rate from -1 to 1, so the controls can be remapped, or come from
anywhere else, touch controls for instance, while the mode is not active. The mouse's movement turns the
view as well.

While the mode is active it owns the camera's field of view: `mode.fovOffset` (radians, default 0)
is added to it, for instance to widen the view while sprinting, as in GTA 5.

The module also exports `clampPitch(pitch)`, which keeps a pitch short of 85 degrees up or down, where
Cesium would turn the view around.
