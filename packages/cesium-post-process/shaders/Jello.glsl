// The jello of a vibrating camera with a rolling shutter: the sensor reads its rows one after
// another, so each row sees the camera at a different moment of its shake, and straight edges
// wobble. After Readout's readout pass (stoatworks-labs, MIT): row r of H is read
// `readout * (1 - r / H)` before the frame, the camera's pose is taken at the middle of the row's
// exposure, and the shake is a few sinusoids in x, y and rotation. The phases come from the CPU,
// in double precision; the picture is magnified by zoom so that its edges do not show.
